archive of my Digital Communication term project combining Python programming, Deep Learning models and Signal Processing in the toolbox.

Project aims to classify 8 different signal types by the help of a neural net trained for that. The neural net is not very clever and needs some help but the aim on this project was to see if Signal Classification could be combined with Neural Nets
